This is a WIP. The majority of this repo is boilerplate created by [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). [cyndipipeline_controller.go](pkg/controller/cyndipipeline/cyndipipeline_controller.go) contains the logic for the operator. The yaml files in the [deploy](deploy) directory contain the schema definitions. `deploy.sh` is a helper script to deploy the operator to a local [CRC](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/) instance.
